    <h1>Hello, Forms!</h1>
<!--The <form> element 
This element formally defines a form. It's a container element like a <div> or <p> element, but it also supports some specific attributes to configure the way the form behaves. 
Technically, all of its attributes are optional.
     It's standard practice to always set at least the action attribute and the method attribute:

The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with. Browsers support only two values for this attribute: "get" and "post". You will use "post" 99% of the time.
For now, add the above <form> element above into the HTML body after the <h1> element that reads "Hello, Forms!".
    
    
    
    
    -->
        <form action="/form-handling-url" method="post">

        </form>
</body>
